  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 20, 2025</p>

  <p>At <strong>WiFi Monitor</strong>, your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app. By using WiFi Monitor, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>WiFi Monitor is designed to analyze and optimize wireless networks. To provide its features, the app may access and process the following technical information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>WiFi network details such as SSID, BSSID, frequency, and channel.</li>
    <li>Signal strength and stability data over time.</li>
    <li>Speed test results (download, upload, latency, and jitter).</li>
    <li>Connection performance metrics (e.g. link speed, network quality).</li>
    <li>Optionally saved result history if you choose to store test results.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> WiFi Monitor does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or location unless voluntarily provided by you for support purposes.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>The collected information is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To display real-time analysis of your WiFi performance.</li>
    <li>To generate and display historical performance reports for your own use.</li>
    <li>To allow you to share or export reports, if you choose.</li>
    <li>To troubleshoot and improve app reliability and functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All test results, logs, and WiFi analysis data are stored locally on your device. If you choose to delete the app or clear app data, the stored information will be permanently removed from your device.</p>
  <p>If you opt to share reports externally or upload them to a server, those actions are entirely under your control. WiFi Monitor does not transmit your data without your consent.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>WiFi Monitor does not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs that track your personal activity across apps. If we introduce optional services such as cloud backup or server reporting in the future, those features will be clearly explained and require your consent.</p>

  <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>WiFi Monitor is not directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe we may have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us so we can promptly delete it.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to ensure that your local data remains protected. Since results are stored only on your device, data security largely depends on proper use and protection of your device itself.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may clear or delete stored test results from within the app at any time.</li>
    <li>You may choose not to share or export any WiFi reports externally.</li>
    <li>You may uninstall the app to remove all stored information from your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy may be updated in the future to reflect new features, security improvements, or legal requirements. Please review it periodically to stay informed of any changes.</p>
